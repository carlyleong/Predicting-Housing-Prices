# Predicting-Housing-Prices

The purpose of this project was to predict final sale prices of houses from the data set that was given. Kaggle gave a train and test data set and our job was to clean and create models by coding in R to predict the House prices of the test data set. Once we created our models and predicted the house prices, you submit your predictions to Kaggle and you are given RMSE score. The lower the error score, the more accurate your predictions are.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45368b01-92fa-4aa2-9ad4-26e0c500baa5)
